# SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software

This is a command-line based application that runs on a terminal window. 

### [Project 0 - Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/sanjiblamichhane/SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software/tree/master/pro_0_python)

### [Project 1 - Searching and Sorting Algorithms Implementation](https://github.com/sanjiblamichhane/SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software/tree/master/pro_1_python)

### [Project 2 - Character String Manipulation](https://github.com/sanjiblamichhane/SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software/tree/master/pro_2_python)

### [Project 3 - Operator Overloading](https://github.com/sanjiblamichhane/SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software/tree/master/pro_3_python)

## Getting Started

- Download and clone the application:
```
git clone git@github.com:sanjiblamichhane/SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software.git
```
- Change directory into cloned folder.
```
cd SL_Python_Student_Directory_Software.git
```

- Each Proect runs independently but they're dependent on each other.
- Run the mains. For example:
```
python main0_1.py
```

The above command runs the main1 of project 0. In this way all mains can be run.
